# TicketFinder
This was a final project for my Web Programming course at NKU. Inspired by the lack of simplicity on TicketMaster. ðŸ™‚

It is built primarily in PHP and works with a mySQL database (SQL file in root folder will create tables and insert dummy data). 
Of course, also HTML and CSS. I strived to make this site work without JavaScript for quicker load times. 
Any animations are done with CSS3 animations. 

I utilized the Skeleton CSS Framework to speed up the design. Big thanks to dev for Skeleton (getskeleton.com). 

I'll likely come back to this project every now and again and use it as a playground to add more features if I'm trying to
learn new things, fix any bugs, or I'm bored.
