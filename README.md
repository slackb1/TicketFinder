#csc301_finalproject

This is a course project for the end of the semester in 'Web Programming' at NKU. 
It is built primarily in PHP. I utilized the light CSS Framework 'Skeleton' for basic grid setups and to speed up the development process for this project. 

This is a 'Ticket Master Clone' of sorts. 
The site will automatically manage it's own database in the background and keep it updated. 

It allows users to see upcoming shows and reserve tickets for them as well as edit and remove all the tickets they have. 

The system will not allow for users to reserve more than 5 tickets. 
Admin users can also add, remove, and edit events. 

Originally I planned to allow admin users to add/edit images but unfortunately the upload scripts I wrote are not allowed based on the server the project is hosted on (csweb.hh.nku.edu). You will find the upload code commented out. 

Another thing I would have loved to implement was the Google Maps API into the app. I was going to have a Google Map embedded into each event page so users could quickly grab directions or get an idea of where the venue was. I was going to use the API to locate the venue and/or city.
I didn't go through with this idea because I wouldn't have been able to optain an API key for the private hosting (csweb.hh.nku.edu). 

This is the baseline of a project that could be used for a company or organization that allows employees/members to reserve tickets to upcoming events that company/organization has purchased a bulk set of tickets for (in this case the company bought 50 tickets for each event). Generous company to work for, eh? We all can dream.
